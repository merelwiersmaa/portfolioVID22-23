						<p>He first gained attention in early 1940 when he was operating as a masked professional criminal leader known as the Red Hood. The Red Hood and his men attempted to rob a profitable manufacturing business adjacent to a chemical processing plant. Batman and Robin arrived on the scene and the Red Hood escaped by running through the chemical plant. He was left with little choice but to dive into a large vat of steaming chemicals. According on one printing of the Joker's origin, the chemicals were the inks used to make playing cards. Batman and Robin naturally assumed that their adversary died being exposed to the heated toxic chemicals. </p>
						<p>The Red Hood actually survived the chemical bath and managed to escape through a drainage pipe that emptied out into the river. However when he emerged from the waste pipes, he discovered that the chemicals turned his hair green, his skin chalk-white and his lips rouge red. Driven partially insane from the experience, the criminal decided to pattern himself after the playing cards Joker character that the chemicals were used to create. Soon after his recreation and new name, the Joker quickly became a noted criminal entity in Gotham City's criminal underground.</p>

						<h3>Cesar Romero</h3> <!-- Van: https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Joker_(Batman_1966_TV_Series) -->
						<p>The 1966 Batman series's incarnation of the Joker marked the first time that the character was depicted in non-comics media; live action. Romero's energy, shrieking laugh, and many creative deathtraps left a powerful impression on many audiences at the time, and continues to be remembered fondly even today, decades after the series had ended. Even the mustache that remained visible on Romero's face during Batman's filming has achieved a certain level of fame, becoming accepted by many as the most recognizable element of this particular incarnation of the Joker.</p>
						<p>Though Romero was nearly sixty at the time, he was offered the role of the Joker, he infused the role with a powerful enthusiasm. Romero refused to shave his mustache for the role of the Joker, even though the character had always been (and still is) portrayed as clean-shaven in the comics. As a result, the makeup that Romero wore to imitate the Joker's chalk-white skin tone was applied directly over the mustache, leaving the mustache partially visible during filming.
						   Romero would later go on to state that the wig bothered him more than any other part of the Joker's costume, as it was glued to his forehead and tended to give him headaches.</p>

						<h3>Jack Napier</h3> <!-- Van: https://batman.fandom.com/wiki/The_Joker_(Burtonverse) -->
						<p>Born in Brooklyn, Jack Napier came to live in Gotham City. In his school years, Jack proved himself to be emotionally unstable, but was highly intelligent, and showed aptitude in art, science and chemistry. He also turned to a life of violent crime. When he was fifteen, Jack was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon. He also implied that he may have also murdered people, including his own parents, since he was a kid. Napier also got into a sadistic habit of asking his victims whether they "danced with the Devil in/by the pale moonlight" before he shot them.</p>
						<p>Jack started off as a man with black hair and a Caucasian complexion and wore business suits with black shoes, a black trench-coat, a matching fedora and black gloves. After his transformation into the Joker, both his hair and fingernails were changed to emerald green, his skin became chalk-white and his lips were flushed ruby-red. Ricocheted shrapnel from a bullet had severed the nerves in his cheeks and after a botched plastic surgery attempt to repair them, left him with a permanent rictus grin. Though he would occasionally apply himself with various cosmetic products to give himself a more normal-looking skin tone and hair color that resembled his original appearance.</p>

						<h3>Jack Napier, but animated</h3> <!-- Van: https://batmantheanimatedseries.fandom.com/wiki/Joker -->
						<p>Voiced by Mark Hamill, after becoming the crazy criminal and mob boss known as Joker, he started perpetrating crimes with the sole purpose of creating chaos. He would also give to himself multiple fake tragic backstories to convince people to have sympathy and working for him. As a recurrent patient of Arkham Asylum, the Joker psycho-analyzed by Dr. Harleen Quinzel. After one session, the Joker fooled Dr. Quinzel as he painted himself as a misunderstood soul crying out for the world to accept him. Quinzel soon found herself in love with the Joker, and broke him out of Arkham.</p>
						<p>Regardless of the state of his seriously twisted mind, The Joker was a brilliant planner, and never appeared to run out of schemes. Often, The Joker's plans were connected to humor and were extremely perilous which resulted in him being dreaded wherever his schemes took him. The Joker could lie effortlessly and was remarkably accomplished at making up heart-rending stories that were capable of deceiving people into believing that he was simply misinterpreted, or in Harley Quinn's case, essentially taking pity on him and making her determined to help him in any way possible.</p>

						<h3>His artwork</h3> <!-- Van: https://screenrant.com/joker-cosplay-alex-ross-art-live-action/ -->
						<p>The god-tiered Joker artwork by the incredibly talented and widely renowned artist Alex Ross comes to life in the form of jaw-dropping cosplay. Alex Ross is known for his hyper-realistic style and amazingly detailed artwork, which consists of anything from comic covers to stand-alone pieces. One of the most iconic of his work is the image of the Joker in his tuxedo that is so perfectly crafted that it looks like a photograph. there is no shortage of unique characters that Ross has applied their iconic style to. One of the most widely recognized superhero pieces done by Ross are the covers for DC Comics’ Kingdom Come miniseries for which Ross received a number of Eisner and Harvey Awards for both the covers and pages of the miniseries.</p>
						<p>While Ross’ work on Kingdom Come is perhaps their most widely recognized due in part to the live-action adaptation it received, one could argue that Ross’ Joker is just as popular as it too received the live action treatment in the film Suicide Squad which showed a brief scene ripped straight from Ross’ “Tango With Evil.” Now, it seems Ross’ version of the Joker has received another live action adaptation in the form of this incredibly impressive Joker cosplay, one that makes Alex Ross’ god-tier art a live-action reality.</p>

						<h2>The Dark Knight</h2>
						<h3>Chaos</h3>
						<p>The Joker was the personification of chaos and madness. However, the Joker himself claimed to not be insane, but rather "ahead of the curve". This proved to be at least partially true, as the Joker was a competent strategist who could easily get inside people's heads, predict their actions, and plan accordingly. He was able to plan out events and improvised when he needed to, showing a high level of intellegence. Joker subscribed to a nihilistic philosophy and was obsessed with the limits of morality, that reflected the Joker's doubts about the depths of human morality, based on his belief that "When the chips are down; these civilized people, they'll eat each other."</p>
						<p>Along with being extremely sadistic through psychological torture, physical pain, and intimidation, the Joker also seemed to have no care for his own safety or survival, such as when Batman threw him off the skyscraper to his supposed death and did nothing but laugh, due to him believing that he would 'win' by provoking Batman into commit murder, which would prove him right about the depths of human morality.</p>
						<p>"Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. Some men just want to watch the world burn."</p>

						<p>
							This one really shows the relationship between de Joker and his beloved Harley Quinn, the King and Queen of crime. At the beginning of Suicide Squad, we learn that Harley Quinn wasn't always the wild and unpredictable villain she is today. Harley Quinn was once Dr. Harleen Quinzel, a psychiatrist who was assigned to be Joker's therapist. While she thought she was helping to cure the clown, she was falling in love with him. Joker was able to manipulate the doctor's feelings and turn her into his obsessive partner in crime.
						</p>
						<p>
							Some time before, Joker managed to kill Batman's crime-fighting partner Robin. In an act of vengeance, Batman smashed Joker's teeth in, permanently damaging his smile and eventually got his teeth replaced with metallic grills. To mark his change at the hands of Batman's fury, Joker got a "Damaged" tattooed on his forehead, permanently reminding both himself and Batman of what had occurred between them.

						<h3>Lego Universe</h3> <!-- Van: https://batman.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lego_Batman_Movie & https://thelegomovie.fandom.com/wiki/The_Joker -->
						<p>
							Within the DC superhero dimension in the Lego Universe, Batman continues to protect Gotham City and fight crime. During his latest mission to stop the Joker from destroying the city, Batman hurts Joker's feelings by telling him he is not as important in Batman's life as he thinks he is, leading Joker to seek the ultimate revenge on him.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Joker has pale white skin, messy and spiky green hair, big eyebrows, wears red lipstick and has a mouth full of yellow shark-like teeth. He describes his body as "too much flab, not enough ab", implying that he may be chubby, though it's not visible since he is a standard LEGO minifigure.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unlike most depictions of Joker, this one is slightly more vulnerable and sensitive. He feels attached to Batman and is disappointed when Batman tells him that he doesn't see anything special in their relationship. Still, he is still extremely manipulative and intelligent, as he managed to make up a pretty simple but effective plan that included manipulating Batman. Most of the time, he is pretty polite to Batman despite their rivalry. He is shown surprisingly to not like too much violence towards Batman.

						<p>
							Jerome Cicero Valeska was a deranged, mass murderer and anarchist. He was the more vengeful and chaotic twin brother of the obsessive and methodical anarchist mastermind, Jeremiah Valeska. Born and raised in Haly's Circus, Jerome murdered his mother roughly at the age of eighteen, which led to his arrest and incarceration at Arkham Asylum.
						</p>
						<p>
							When Jerome died at one point, his frozen corpse found its way to a cult worshipping person who tried to bring him back to life. This didn't work, so he cut off Jerome's face and 'became' Jerome. This being Gotham, being dead and without a face doesn't stop you coming back to life, so Jerome suddenly woke up after being taken to the morgue, and hunted down that person to get his face back and stapled it back on.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of his most noticeable traits was his disturbed sense of humor which was accompanied with a never-ending, manic giggling and outright laughter towards everything which fit right within Jerome's own beliefs on what was funny. He was sadomasochistic, merciless and destructive, so he found immense joy in the idea of pain and death towards others.

						<h3>Arthur Fleck</h3> <!-- Van: https://dcmovies.fandom.com/wiki/Arthur_Fleck -->
						<p>
							Arthur had a difficult childhood, suffering bullying from his peers as well as enduring abuse when he was a child. He lived with his mother Penny Fleck who had possibly adopted him. Enduring his abuse, Arthur was found tied to a radiator, bruised and malnourished; he suffered severe head trauma that was believed to have given him his laughing disorder. His disorder caused him to laugh involuntarily at inappropriate times, heightening particularly when he was tensed. He was a very lonely individual whose only company was his mother, but he longed for a romantic relationship- something he was unable to form due to his mental illness.
						</p>
						<p>
							Longing for a loving father figure in his life, Arthur saw the likes of talk show host Murray Franklin and billionaire Thomas Wayne as his father figures, even daydreaming about being on the Murray Franklin Show and Murray telling him he wished he had a son just like him. He later came to believe Thomas Wayne was his father after reading a letter written by his mother in which she claimed he was her and Thomas's son. If this is true, it would be so that young Bruce (Batman) and Arthur (The Joker) are in fact, half-brothers.
